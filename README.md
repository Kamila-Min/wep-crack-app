# WEP Crack App
This is a mini app which help you to crack the nearest wifi-nets only protected by the WEP protocol. The App implemented in Python using the EEL library.

# How it works
The application can be run under Linux system, running under sudo.

You also need to download an [Aircrack-ng](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/). A set of tools for auditing wireless networks, which is widely used for testing the security of Wi-Fi networks. This will help us in the work of the project.

Use:
```
sudo apt install aircrack-ng
```
To implement the front, the EEL library is used to link JS and Python.

To install EEL use: 
```
pip install eel
```
